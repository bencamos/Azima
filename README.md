# Azima
## What B*** Couldn't Do

Azima is a framework designed to automatically and hopefully autonomously.
Designed to run any amount of programs including but not limited to, security automation, threat evaluation and blocking as well as all the developmental tools you may need when programming for it.
## Features

- Uncollapsible architecture; meaning any portion of code can be altered or even taken offline without effecting anything else.
- Intuitive design controls and administration.
- Ghost like security protocols and defence; You wont even know its watching your feeble penetration attempts.


## Why

Unlike most security software that requires configurations like DNS to be functional, Azima dosen't.
Instead Azima has several layers of security protocols, with the primary being a MITM like system.
Inspecting every packet on the network, looking for out of place or unsual data before intercepting it.

Due to the way Azima is designed its near impossible to shut it down.
You can try to "disconnect" it, but another clone will just pop up on another machine in the network.
Similar to a P2P network Azima will sit idle on every machine possible continually injecting itself keeping it alive.
Once Azima "sleep" mode detects Azima is "offline" and no longer is broadcasting itself across the network.
It will then become the leader by announcing it has awoken and will now lead. As each machine will attempt to launch at the same time only the fastest online will be successful and the rest will return to idle.
The new leader will attempt to restore the old into its sleeping mode. Continuing the cycle.

> "Couldn't you just see who is broadcasting and block them until all the machines are down?"

This would require you to be faster then Azima to restart. Which is possible however since no broadcasts are made you are now dealing with an unknown number of live versions attacking you. Secondly IPv4 is a vulnerabile system, especially in a private network. All Azima has to do is spoof whos broadcasting and it can't be found with ease.

> "Couldn't I just fake being Azima? So nothing starts."

Theoretically, yes. However that would require you to have a running authentication protocol and calculate the next authentication key in sequence without fail. This would require you to get your hands on the compiled code in charge of generating these. However you can't get the generator without having it. You could think you could just disconnect the machine with Azimas software from the network, but now how would you connect to the network with that code and no leader has given you a live one?
It's a dead end.

Azima isn't your normal firewall.
